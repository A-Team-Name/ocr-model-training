Some weights of VisionEncoderDecoderModel were not initialized from the model checkpoint at microsoft/trocr-base-stage1 and are newly initialized: ['encoder.pooler.dense.bias', 'encoder.pooler.dense.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
The new embeddings will be initialized from a multivariate normal distribution that has old embeddings' mean and covariance. As described in this article: https://nlp.stanford.edu/~johnhew/vocab-expansion.html. To disable this, use `mean_resizing=False`
